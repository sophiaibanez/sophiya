Hello all.

I am Phia, 19 years old, a December baby.
My mom gave birth to me in Manila, but I grew up in Imus, Cavite. That province is my home.
I am currently on my 2nd year as a college student, and I am proud to say that I am UST-ECE kid.

Documentaries, unsolved mysteries and sci-fi films are my go-to movies. Though, I am fond of watching K-Dramas more.
When it comes to food, calamares is my favorite. But I'm a one call away person if called for a Samgyup!
Music is my comfort zone. I really love listening to it, and playing it.
For years, I have played in an orchestra with my trumpet, which I consider as my bestfriend.

To what my future holds, I always trust God's plans for me.
But I hope and pray that I'll get that "Engr." before my name.
